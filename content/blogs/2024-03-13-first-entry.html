    <p>
    Today I learned HTML to the extent that I wanted to. I had little prior knowledge, but I am a fast learner.
    </p>

    <p>
    It all started this morning, when my brother asked me what text editor he should use. I previously set him up with VSCodium. I had it bound to a keybinding, so all he had to do was press <strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>e</strong> to open the editor. Unfortunately, I was not accustom to VSCodium's quirks, and the editor opened multiple instances. When I closed one, all of them closed.
    </p>

    <p>
     I then decided to set him up with Vis. Vis is a Vim-like editor. It combines Vim's modal functionality with Sam's regex. I installed it, and then tried to tell him the keybinds. After getting through a couple, I decided that it would be better to write them. I told him what to type (in Vis), and he typed it. By the end, we had created a list of all of the Vis bindings that I knew. Then my brother, out of confusion, thought that we were turning it into a website. I though that it was a good idea, so that is what we did.
    </p> 

    <p>
    My brother had been taking an HTML course on the <a href="https://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> tutorial site for a few weeks now, and I was confident that he had the ability to create a website (though hadn't tried). He began to add the tags and soon enough the site was finished, or at least the rough draft. As we went along, I told him what buttons to press in Vis. Our product was a list of all of the Vis bindings, in a nice format. The keys where in <strong>bold</strong>, and all of keybinds where under their mode headings.
    </p> 

    <p>
    I was able to pick up HTML just from our little craft. Suckless web design is what I prefer. Incedintually, Suckless web design requires little HTML knowledge. From our experience, I was ultimately able to create this blog.
    </p> 
       
    <p>
    After we opened the site in the browser, I suggested that we center the text. I was mistaken when I had said that we should <q>center</q> the site. I meant that we should add margine, and when my brother centered the text, it looked weird. So we looked at the source HTML of a <a href="https://pspodcasting.net/dan/blog/2019/plan9_desktop.html">site</a> that I wanted our site to look like. We found that it used margin (<b>40px</b>). I decided that we should just copy all of the CSS from the site.
    </p> 

    <p>
    Unfortunatly, the site's CSS was all in a single line! I couldn't allow that. I reformatted it, and my brother did not like the formatting. We got into a dispute about formatting. We continued to work on the site. I had to go to the chiropractor, so my brother was on his own for a few hours.
    </p>

    <p>
    I was horrified to find him looking at Sublime text when we got back. I did not want him to get screwed by proprietary garbage, so I frantically convinced him to use something else. He said that Vis was <q>ugly</q> and that he wanted to <q>try</q> other text editors. He had pulled up a site that had a list of the <q>best</q> editors. Of course Sublime was number one. Get this: Vim was number six! I told him not to listen to <q>neckbeards</q> on the internet. I showed him <a href="https://nvchad.com">NVChad</a>, and I tied to set it up for him. I was unsucsessful, and decided to see if he would compromise on using a Vis theme. He did on Gruvbox.
    </p> 

    <p>
    I had also caught him hosting a git repo on Github. Github is proprietary garbage, so I  told him to host it on <a href="https://git.disroot.org">Disroot</a> instead. I showed him the ropes, and sent him a text file with instructions on how to use <b>git</b> from the command line. Then I helped him set it up. I submitted some pull requests on the website repo, and the developement continued on Disroot.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before I left for the chiropractor, my mother saw the site on (my system), and she thought it looked good. At the end of the day, the site did not look much different. The <a href="https://git.disroot.org/Bueller206/website">code</a> did. I looked at the code of the site that I wanted our site to look like, and I relized they did a lot of things better. For instance, they indented. I used a combination of their's and my own coding style to create this site.

    Grandma, If you are reading this, <strong>you cannot make me fix my spelling and grammar mistakes.</strong> Take that. Want them fixed? You'll have to submut a pull request on Disroot Git: <a href="https://git.disroot.org/oink/blogs">https://git.disroot.org/oink/blogs</a>. Ha ha. Good luck.
